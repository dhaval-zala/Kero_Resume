It includes what Oracle calls "Hot-Pluggable" architecture, which allows users to leverage existing investments in applications and systems from other software vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, and SAP AG.My responsibilities at Oracle America,Inc. :Design, develop, troubleshoot and test softwares.\r\nWrite test plans, test cases, and perform manual and automated testing.\r\nFixes bugs on hardware platforms, including Linux and Windows.\r\nPerforms install testing for Fusion Middleware products\r\nPerforms configuration testing for Oracle application server releases..\r\nInteracts with development, release, and Product Management to obtain functional requirements and code fixes.\r\nPerform functional testing on SOA and Webcenter components.Perform automation using python,javascript.\r\nDevelops projects using Jdeveloper.\r\nRecommend future directions of software product releases and help establish product policy.Scenarios executed by me at Oracle America,Inc. :Create/Extend domains using FMW components like SOA, BAM,Webcenter (servers used are Weblogic/Websphere)\r\nInstall/Configure Oracle database and load/manage schemas for each component using Repository Creation Utility (RCU)\r\nConfigure unicast/multicast CLUSTERS by distributing servers across remote machines or in localhost\r\nAssociate domains with external LDAP by migrating/reassociating policy & credential stores. And manage user roles.\r\nWire all the components to WEBTIER and use OHS port to access my component\'s home page.\r\nDevelop/deploy applications to servers/clusters using WLST, EM & JDeveloper\r\nMonitor/Manage the entire domain (servers/applications) using Enterprise Manager (EM),\r\nPerform automation using DTE(Distributed Topology Environment) by constructing topologies and executing ADE commands.Environment: Java (J2EE), XML, Linux, Java Script, Python, Oracle.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Semester Long Master\'s Degree Project Illinois Institute Of Technology,Chicago Chicago,IL Project : Banking applicationDeveloped Banking application using MVC architecture.\r\nThis application was developed using Java/J2ee based on the MVC architecture.\r\nIt has several modules such as Login, Registration, Money Transfer and Mini statement.\r\nThe data in database is managed effectively using RDBMS, J2EE and JDBC.\r\nThe Servlet (controller) manages the flow of application. Some custom Exceptions also handled.\r\nServlet filters are used here to filter the URL requests in the application.Environment:Java, J2EE (Servlet, JSP), Tomcat, XML, HTML, Java Script,#MVC, Mysql, SQL, PL/SQL, AWT GUI and Swing GUI.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Software Developer Anna Silicon Technology, India Chennai,Tamil Nadu  Project:  Sales and Service ManagementIt was designed and developed the using J2SE, J2EE, Struts and Oracle technologies. It has couple of modules such as Sales Management, Customer Management, Inventory, Service Management, and Administration. Responsibilities: Involved in Analysis, design, development and testing of the database.Implemented design patterns – DTO, DAO, and SingletonPatterns.JavaScript implemented using validation field Implemented MVC architecture using Struts framework.DTO, DAO implemented as data services for the application and implemented exception handling for the application.Implemented Data Source to connect the data base as connection pooling and implemented stored procedures for the data base operations. Environment: Java (J2SE, J2EE), Struts, JSP, Servlets, EJB, HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, SQL, PL/SQL, Oracle.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Internship Student Larsen And Toubro (L&T), India Chennai,Tamil Nadu Project: Construction Enterprise Management (CeMa)\r\nCeMa was designed and developed the using VB and Oracle technologies. CeMa has modules such as Construction Management, Sales Management, Inventory Management, Salary Management, Service Management, and Administration.Responsibility:Developed GUI (Graphical User Interface) and technical specification of Construction Enterprise Management, a business management system, for third-party vendors.Environment: Visual Basic, Oracle.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- '
